Day Pena – Stage 2 

Classes: Admin, DeliveryPerson, Customer, DiscountCoupon, Restaurant

I was responsible for implementing my classes in the UML diagram that handle User, admin, customer, delivery person, discount, and restaurant functions

Admin - The Admin class manages CRUD operations for customers, restaurants, delivery person, and delivery vehicle through lists and methods.

DeliveryPerson - This class represents delivery drivers and includes attributes for status, assigned orders, and with relationship to DeliveryVehicle.

Customer - I built the Customer class to store customer information and order history. It includes methods to manage and review past orders, maintaining a relationship with Order.

DiscountCoupon - The DiscountCoupon class handles coupon logic with attributes for code, discountAmount, and valid. It provides methods to apply discounts and verify coupon validity.

Restaurant - This class defines restaurant details and connects to a Menu class which will have their items.
